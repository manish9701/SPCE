# Project Title: SPCE


## Description
SPCE is a React,typescript-based application. This project leverages a proxy server and a JSON file to simulate a backend for development and testing purposes.

### Scripts
To run the project, you will need to execute the following commands in separate terminals (the last 2 are temporary and won't be required in future versions):

- ### `npm start`
  
  This command starts the React application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- **Proxy Server**:
   ### `npm start`
  
  This command runs the proxy server defined in `server.js`, allowing you to handle API requests for TLE data during development.

- **JSON Server**:
  ### `json-server --watch db.json --port 3005`
  
  This command starts a JSON server that watches the `db.json` file for changes and serves it on port 3005. This simulates a database for this application.
